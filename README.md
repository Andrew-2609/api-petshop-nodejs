# Pet Shop API

This is my first API created with NodeJS, based on one of [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br)'s courses.

## Part I

### What does it do?

It retrieves data from a fictional Pet Shop with suppliers (fornecedores, in Portuguese) that can also be persisted, 
updated and deleted. Therefore, this API has a
simple [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) and endpoints to perform these operations.

### What technologies and libraries were used?

Basically, this API utilizes **_express_** as the **server** framework, **_sequelize_** as
the [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) and a database with MySQL.

Although you can find the libraries in the `package.json` file, here's a list with them and links to their official
documentation:

* [express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)
* [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)
* [jsontoxml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsontoxml)
* [config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config)

## Part II - Coming soon

### What's new?

Now this API also retrives data from products (produtos, in Portuguese) related to suppliers, that can also be persisted, updated and deleted as well.

The used technologies are basically the same! And the logic used to build this second part is very similar to the previous one, so it shouldn't be harder to understand.

Thanks for accessing this repository! See ya.
